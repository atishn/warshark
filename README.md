The game risk.


A HUGE reboot of Warfish.

1. install nodejs
2. install npm
3. Checkout/clone from repository.
4. run: npm install
5. sh start.sh
6. goto localhost:3000

All Backend API Can be accessed through

http://localhost:3000/apidoc/#/api


Current backend functionality supports creation and start of game.
Missing piece is making move between moved by user. This needs to be taken care by next developer whoever takes control of this project.
Once that, this project has all backend services atleast for creation of game and play of game until it ends.
